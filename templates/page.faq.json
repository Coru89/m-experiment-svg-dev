The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate section (this “Agreement to Arbitrate”).<\/p><p>(a) Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief<\/p><p>You and we agree that each of us may bring claims that relate to or arise from your use of or access to our Services, any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services, or communications (including calls, texts, or emails) that relate to or arise from your use of or access to our Services only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding, including but not limited to actions under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227 et seq., the California Invasion of Privacy Act, Cal. Penal Code § 630 et seq., and other federal and state telemarketing and privacy laws. Unless both you and us agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form if a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief, including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief, only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect our other users.<\/p><p>(b) Arbitration Procedures<\/p><p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of this Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate or this Agreement is void or voidable.<\/p><p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adr.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.adr.org<\/a> .<\/p><p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and\/or us, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.<\/p><p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving our other users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.<\/p><p>This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement to Arbitrate and the closing of your Account or your use of or access to our Services, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services.<\/p><p>(c) Costs of Arbitration<\/p><p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by us should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by us on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.<\/p><p>(d) Confidentiality<\/p><p>The arbitration proceedings and arbitration award shall be maintained by the parties as strictly confidential, except as is otherwise required by court order or as is necessary to confirm, vacate or enforce the award and for disclosure in confidence to the parties’ respective attorneys, tax advisors and senior management and to family members of a party who is an individual.<\/p><p>(e) Severability<\/p><p>With the exception of any of the provisions in of this Agreement to Arbitrate (“Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (“Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”) is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply.<\/p>"

As described in this Policy, we may also make your information available to third parties for their direct marketing purposes (except for your phone number or biometric information).<\/p><p>If you choose to exercise these rights, we will not discriminate against you because of it.<br\/>You or your authorized agent can request: 1) a disclosure of your personal information we collect, use, disclose, or sell; 2) to delete your personal information we collect, or maintain; and 3) to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. If you choose to submit a request through an authorized agent, we will require proof that the authorized agent has your written permission to submit a request on your behalf. Additionally, we may require you to verify your identity with us through the verification process detailed below. <\/p><p>(b)Requests to Know and Requests to Delete<\/p><p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:<\/p><p>- The specific pieces and categories of personal information we collected about you.<\/p><p>-The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.<\/p><p>-Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.<\/p><p>-The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.<\/p><p>-If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:<\/p><p>-sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and<\/p><p>-disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.<\/p><p>You also have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request to delete, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.<\/p><p>You may submit a request to know or request to delete, free of charge, online through our interactive webform <a href=\"http:\/\/e.luxottica.com\/pub\/sf\/ResponseForm?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DYQpglLjHJlYQGiTj6Jf39g6LiOsKzfWrBHmzfH7zgOyr7RzcCo3VXMtX%3DYQpglLjHJlYQGszfSrLdLe9CMNg7pdfEzdfh47Wn8CB3JGpq3&_ei_=EjMUxrCFkVpafqdZyE8bu1s&brand=OO&lang=EN&SourceOrigin=WebApp\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>, or through our toll-free number at <br\/><br\/>M-Experiment: 800-403-7449 <br\/><br\/>Note: for requests to delete, we will require you to separately confirm that you want your personal information deleted. To verify your identity, we require you provide your name and email and to confirm your identity through a confirmation email message. For some requests, we may also require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request. Once submitted, you will receive an email within 10 business days that we will use to verify your identity and provide confirmation of your request. If we cannot verify your identity within 45 days, we may deny your request. We will respond to your request to know or request to delete within 45 days from the day we receive the request. If necessary, we may extend the time period to a maximum total of 90 days from the day we receive the request. In such case, you will receive an email notifying you of the extension and explaining the reason for the extension. Any disclosure in response to a request to know will cover the 12-month period preceding the business’s receipt of the request and will be delivered in a readily useable digital format, or by mail at your request. <br\/>Your request to know or request to delete may be denied for any reason allowable under the CCPA. For example, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:<\/p><p>-Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.<\/p><p>-Comply with a legal obligation.<\/p><p>-Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it or any other purpose permitted by the CCPA.<\/p><p>Similarly, we may deny requests:<\/p><p>-If the information is not subject to the CCPA or otherwise excluded from the CCPA’s scope. Excluded information may include the following:<\/p><p>-publicly available information from government records;<\/p><p>-deidentified or aggregated consumer information; <\/p><p>-health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) or the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA), clinical trial data, or other qualifying research data;<\/p><p>-personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994; and<\/p><p>-certain workforce-related personal information and business-to-business communication.<\/p><p>-For specific pieces of personal information if the disclosure creates a substantial, articulable, and unreasonable risk to the security of that personal information, your account with us, or the security of our systems or networks.<\/p><p>-To access or delete information that is de-identified.<\/p><p>-If your identity cannot be verified to a degree of certainty required by the CCPA.<\/p><p>-From an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by the consumer to act on the consumer’s behalf.<\/p><p>(c)Request to Opt-Out<\/p><p>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to opt-out from a sale of your personal information. We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the \"right to opt-in\") from either the consumer who is between 13 and less than 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.<\/p><p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you may submit a request at Do Not Sell My Personal Information or through our toll-free number at<br\/><br\/>M-Experiment: 800-403-7449 <br\/><br\/>We will act upon your request no later than 15 days from the date we received the request. Note that we may deny a request to opt-out if we have a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that the request is fraudulent. Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. <\/p><p>(d)Collection of Personal Information<\/p><p>We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer (“personal information”). In particular, we have collected the following categories of personal information from consumers within the last twelve (12) months:<\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Category<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Examples<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Collected<\/span><\/p><p>(ADD IN CHART)<br\/><br\/>We may obtain the categories of personal information listed above from the following categories of sources:<\/p><p>-Directly from you or your agent.<\/p><p>-Indirectly from you or your agent.

Some of these ads may be tailored to your interests based on your browsing of the service and elsewhere on the Internet, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising” (“Interest-based Advertising”), which may include sending you an ad on a third-party service after you have left the service (i.e., “retargeting”).<br\/><br\/>You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.
